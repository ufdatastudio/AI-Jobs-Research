Redwood City, CA (Hybrid)
The Team
At Learning Commons, we pair technology with grantmaking to scale proven teaching and learning
practices to benefit every learner. We aim to translate what learning science tells us about how
students learn best into classroom practice. With the advent of generative AI, that translation work
can be accelerated and scaled to have a greater impact.
Our mission is to bring learning science into the tools used every day by teachers and students,
ensuring that technology reflects the realities of classrooms and strengthens teaching and learning.
In today’s fragmented edtech landscape, school districts are often left piecing together products
that don’t always align with curricula or instructional needs. While AI holds enormous potential to
support educators, it can only deliver on that promise when grounded in research, high-quality
educational data, and expert evaluation. That’s why we’re building open, public-purpose
infrastructure — datasets, rubrics, and resources — that help raise the standard for educational
tools and create more consistent, impactful learning experiences for all students and teachers.
At our core, we are builders, and our unique builder philanthropy approach is what sets us apart
from other education funders. Take a closer look at the highlights and significant milestones of CZI’s
first eight years of education work.
The Opportunity
Educators are already using AI-based tools in various ways—including generating lesson plans,
creating classroom materials such as tests and assignments, and helping differentiate instruction
for students. We are inspired and excited about the possibilities and promise of AI to accelerate
the availability of research-backed practices at scale. We are actively and thoughtfully exploring
how to incorporate AI into products in close partnership with researchers, experts, and educators.
As a Machine Learning Engineer on the AI/ML team, you will play a crucial role in translating

Partner closely with tech lead, product managers, data scientists, staff engineers, and
expert partners to understand requirements, iterate on solutions, and deliver impactful AI-
driven features.
Stay current with new developments in AI/ML research and identify opportunities for their
practical application within the team's projects.
Write robust, well-tested, and maintainable code, and participate actively in code and design
reviews.
What You'll Bring
Enjoy working in a highly interactive and cross-functional collaborative environment with a
diverse team of colleagues and external partners.
Typically, a minimum of 2 years of relevant industry experience in developing and applying
machine learning methods.
Experience building, training, and deploying AI/ML models, with a good understanding of
deep learning methods.
Expert in programming languages commonly used in ML (e.g., Python) and familiarity with
relevant ML frameworks and libraries.
Experience in translating ML research or prototypes into functional software and features.
Compensation
The Redwood City, CA base pay range for a new hire in this role is $169,000 - $264,000. New
hires are typically hired into the lower portion of the range, enabling employee growth in the range
over time. Actual placement in range is based on job-related skills and experience, as evaluated

Machine Learning Engineer, Education
Apply
Redwood City, CA (Hybrid)
The Team
At Learning Commons, we pair technology with grantmaking to scale proven teaching and learning
practices to benefit every learner. We aim to translate what learning science tells us about how
students learn best into classroom practice. With the advent of generative AI, that translation work
can be accelerated and scaled to have a greater impact.
Our mission is to bring learning science into the tools used every day by teachers and students,
ensuring that technology reflects the realities of classrooms and strengthens teaching and learning.
In today’s fragmented edtech landscape, school districts are often left piecing together products
that don’t always align with curricula or instructional needs. While AI holds enormous potential to
support educators, it can only deliver on that promise when grounded in research, high-quality
educational data, and expert evaluation. That’s why we’re building open, public-purpose
infrastructure — datasets, rubrics, and resources — that help raise the standard for educational
tools and create more consistent, impactful learning experiences for all students and teachers.
At our core, we are builders, and our unique builder philanthropy approach is what sets us apart
from other education funders. Take a closer look at the highlights and significant milestones of CZI’s
first eight years of education work.
The Opportunity
Educators are already using AI-based tools in various ways—including generating lesson plans,
creating classroom materials such as tests and assignments, and helping differentiate instruction
for students. We are inspired and excited about the possibilities and promise of AI to accelerate
the availability of research-backed practices at scale. We are actively and thoughtfully exploring
how to incorporate AI into products in close partnership with researchers, experts, and educators.
As a Machine Learning Engineer on the AI/ML team, you will play a crucial role in translating

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a
single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact —
advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller
and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much
in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're
an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that
we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value
communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This
research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including:
GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute,
Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer
competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous
vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to
collaborate with colleagues.

The expected salary range for this position is:
Annual Salary:
$300,000 - $405,000 USD
Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or
equivalent experience.
Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at
least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas
for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every
reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.
Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that
people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing
imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to
exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.
We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical
implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to
include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a
single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact —
advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller
and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much
in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're
an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that
we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value
communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This
research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including:
GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute,
Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer
competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous
vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to
collaborate with colleagues.

Education Labs is a research-driven team with a product mandate: we study how AI transforms human
capability development, and we build new product paradigms based on what we discover. As a Senior Product
Research Engineer, you'll be the second technical builder on this small, mission-driven team—operating with
research-level autonomy while shipping features that reach millions of users.
This role sits at the intersection of research exploration and product execution. You'll work alongside
researchers studying the societal impacts of AI, while building and shipping features that help people develop
skills—both in working with AI itself and in their broader capabilities. You'll have significant creative license to
define what “good” looks like, exploring new interaction paradigms rather than optimizing existing patterns.
Our team believes that developing skill with AI is fundamental to human agency and flourishing in an AI-
enabled world. We're building experiences that make users more capable, more thoughtful, and more
empowered—not just more engaged. This means integrating skill development principles into product design,
leveraging Claude itself as part of the capability-building journey, and measuring success by how users grow in
their ability to work with AI and apply those skills to their own goals.
You'll be something of a one-person technical shop with full-stack ownership, prototyping new ideas,
establishing technical direction, and shipping production-quality features. You'll need strong product instincts
and clean interface design sensibilities, balanced with comfort in ambiguity and frontier thinking.
Responsibilities:
Build and ship features that help users develop skills in working with AI and translate those skills into their
own capability growth—measuring success by skill development and product mastery, not just engagement
Architect and implement end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end) that test new interaction
paradigms for skill development with AI, including novel uses of Claude as a skill-building partner
Define technical direction and quality standards for capability-focused product work in a research context
—you'll establish patterns others can follow
Collaborate with researchers to translate insights about skill development and human-AI collaboration into
shipped product experiences

11/11/25, 3:23 PM Senior Human-AI Collaboration Research Engineer, Education Labs at Anthropic in San Francisco, California, United States | 6 Ye…
Work closely with product, design, and research teams across Anthropic to influence how skill
development principles shape our broader product strategy
Analyze product data and user behavior using quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how
users develop skills with AI and what actually helps them become more capable
Document and share your work through clear technical writing, prototypes, and presentations that
influence thinking across the organization
Elevate team craft through thoughtful code reviews, technical discussions, and knowledge sharing—
helping others grow their skills
Influence research priorities and team strategy while mentoring through technical leadership—
establishing patterns, stakeholder coordination, reviewing code, and sharing expertise
You may be a good fit if you have:
Strong full-stack engineering experience
6+ years building and shipping web products, with deep expertise across the stack
Strong front-end skills: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, with an eye for clean, intuitive interface
design
Solid back-end and data pipeline experience: Python, API design, data analysis infrastructure
Track record of independently driving features from prototype to production quality
Comfort working as a technical ""one-person shop"" with full ownership
Deep conviction about human capability and agency
Strong perspective on how technology should enhance human capabilities rather than diminish them
Experience or genuine passion for skill development, human-computer interaction, developer tools, or
products that help people become more capable
Understanding that skill development isn't tutorials or onboarding flows—it's experiences that make users
progressively more capable, curious, and empowered over time
Interest in how people develop mastery of AI itself and how that translates to broader capability growth
Skepticism of purely engagement-driven metrics; interest in measuring skill development and capability
outcomes
Research mindset with product execution skills
Comfort with ambiguity and exploring undefined problem spaces—you define what good looks like
Experience working in research contexts or highly exploratory product environments
Ability to rapidly prototype new ideas, test them with users, and iterate toward production
Strong instincts for product design and user experience, even without formal design training
Excitement about frontier thinking and new paradigms, not just optimization

Strategic thinking and focus
Experience setting vision for product projects, defining roadmaps with clear milestones, and maintaining
team focus in exploratory environments
Ability to balance research exploration with concrete deliverables and timelines
Strong sense of prioritization—knowing what to build now, what to defer, and what to cut
Track record of translating ambiguous opportunities into actionable plans
Technical leadership and communication
Experience providing technical direction, particularly in small or early-stage teams
Ability to work effectively alongside researchers, translating between research insights and product
implementation
Strong written and verbal communication—you make complex technical and conceptual ideas accessible
Track record of elevating team output through code quality, documentation, and knowledge sharing
Strong candidates may also have:
Experience in developer tools, creative tools, learning platforms, or other products where user skill
development and mastery matter more than time-on-site
Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI, skill acquisition research, or educational psychology
(formal or self-directed)
Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or analytics that measure capability development
in production
Previous experience in research labs, frontier tech companies, or startups with high autonomy and ambiguity
Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill development, human-AI interaction, or product
philosophy
Experience building AI-native product experiences or working with LLMs in production contexts
What this role is not
This is a hands-on technical role building product features that ship to users, embedded within a research team.
While you'll provide technical guidance and help set direction, this role doesn't involve people management or
traditional team leadership responsibilities. If you're looking to transition into engineering management or lead
a large team, this likely isn't the right fit.
The expected base compensation for this position is below. Our total compensation package for full-time
employees includes equity, benefits, and may include incentive compensation.

$320,000 - $405,000 USD
Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.
However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role
and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we
retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.
We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong
candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from
underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of
their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're
interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical
implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of
diverse perspectives on our team.
How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive
team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of
steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an
empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in
computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure
that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues
many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability,
Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human
Preferences.
Come work with us!
Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation
and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours,
and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. Guidance on Candidates' AI Usage: Learn

Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability
Form CC-305 OMB Control Number 1250-0005
Page 1 of 1 Expires 04/30/2026
Why are you being asked to complete this form?
We are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires
us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified
people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of
our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must
measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask
applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever
had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this
question at least every five years.
Completing this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will
choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes
hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form
and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to
learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department
of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
(OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.
How do you know if you have a disability?
A disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more
of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such
a condition, you are a person with a disability. Disabilities
include, but are not limited to:
Alcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently
using drugs illegally)
Autoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia,
rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS
Blind or low vision
Cancer (past or present)
Cardiovascular or heart disease
Celiac disease
Cerebral palsy
